# Exploratory_Analysis_ASD_Final
# Repeated Measures ANOVA
# Load Libraries
# This is to properly wrangle Cristina and Mark's data for a repeated measures ANOVA or ANCOVA

#Trying the gather function: 

##Load Libraries

library("dplyr")
library("gmodels")

##Stack data one on top of the other - requires the same columns in each

### Need the names and order of the columns
names(asd_toddler_yes)
names(asd_child_yes)
names(asd_adolescent_yes)
names(asd_adult_yes)


###Drop native indian, pacificia, mixed and Class from toddler
toddler_raceSubset <- asd_toddler_yes[, c(1:11, 13:20, 24:26)]
#### Column names need to be the same
toddler_raceSubsetRenames <- toddler_raceSubset %>% rename( white = white.european)
names(toddler_raceSubsetRenames)
child_raceSubsetRenames <- asd_child_yes %>% rename( others = others.)
adolescent_raceSubsetRenames <- asd_adolescent_yes %>% rename( others = others.)
adult_raceSubsetRenames <- asd_adult_yes %>% rename( others = others.)

### Reorder and drop columns to look like the toddler. 'Class' & 'aboriginal' dropped
child_reordered <- child_raceSubsetRenames[,c(1:11, 13, 15, 14, 17, 16, 19, 18, 20, 22:24)]
adolescent_reordered <- adolescent_raceSubsetRenames[, c(1:11, 13, 15, 14, 21, 16, 18, 17, 19, 22:24)]
adult_reordered <- adult_raceSubsetRenames[, c(1:11, 13, 15, 14, 18, 16, 20, 17, 19, 22:24)]

### Check to make sure they are now all the same order and number of columns:

names(toddler_raceSubsetRenames)
names(child_reordered)
names(adolescent_reordered)
names(adult_reordered)

### Add a column to each data frame that adds the time frame on there

toddlerTime <- mutate(toddler_raceSubsetRenames, Time = 0)
childTime <- mutate(child_reordered, Time = 1)
adolescentTime <- mutate(adolescent_reordered, Time = 2)
adultTime <- mutate(adult_reordered, Time = 3)

## Combine data one on top of each other!

all <- rbind(toddlerTime, childTime, adolescentTime, adultTime)

#Independent Chi-Square

CrossTable(all$Time, all$A1, chisq=TRUE, expected = TRUE, sresid=TRUE, format="SPSS")
